Hello people, I am **Tobin Harding**. I code in the Linux environment. I like
command line interfaces and statically typed languages. When I am trying to
relax I listen to classical music, when I'm eating - jazz, and when getting
excitable I like to listen to techno.  I like learning things, mostly computer
related things, but also jiu-jitsu. For health and giggles I do yoga, rock
climb, ferment, and grow vegetables.

I am currently working at CoBlox, a research lab in Sydney primarily writing
Rust code.  We are trying to solve the problem of atomic swap of assets between
blockchains.  The protocol and reference implementation are both open source and
up on [GitHub](https://github.com/comit-network/).

I previously worked for a Californian startup called AppOrbit on their AppSwitch
project.  That meant writing networking code in Golang and messing around with
containers.

I currently work in the cryptocurrency space at CoBloX Research Lab in Sydney.
We are trying to solve atomic trustless swap across different ledgers i.e., we
are trying to make all blockchains inter-operable.  I write Rust all day.

In the past I have done contracting work (under my company name
[Crowd Coded Pty Ltd](https://crowdcoded.com.au)).  I also previously worked for
a California startup called AppOrbit on their AppSwitch project.  That meant
writing networking code in Golang.

I maintain a Perl script within the Linux kernel tree and like to submit the odd
kernel patch now and then.

I have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in computer science as well as a
two year software apprenticeship.

I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales Australia and have three
children.

My favourite thing to do is hold my breath and swim under the ocean as far as I can.
