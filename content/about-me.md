Hello people, I am **Tobin Harding**. I code in the Linux environment. I like
command line interfaces and statically typed languages. When I am trying to
relax I listen to classical music, when I'm eating - jazz, and when getting
excitable I like to listen to techno.  I like learning things, mostly computer
related things, but also jiu-jitsu. For health and giggles I do yoga, rock
climb, ferment, and grow vegetables.

I have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in computer science as well as a
two year software apprenticeship. I currently work on the Linux Kernel.

I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales Australia and have three
children.
