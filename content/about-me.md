Hello people, I am **Tobin Harding**. I code in the Linux environment. I like
command line interfaces and statically typed languages. When I am trying to
relax I listen to classical music, when I'm eating - jazz, and when getting
excitable I like to listen to techno.  I like learning things, mostly computer
related things, but also jiu-jitsu. For health and giggles I do yoga, rock
climb, ferment, grow vegetables.

I currently work in the cryptocurrency space for crypto.com, I write Rust all
day.

In the past I have done Linux Kernel work and container networking, I've
professional proficiency in Rust, C, and Golang. I can hack Python if I need to. 

I have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in computer science as well as a
two year software apprenticeship. I enjoy doing coursera.org courses to improve
my skills.

I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales Australia and have three
children.

My favourite thing to do is hold my breath and swim under the ocean as far as I
can.
