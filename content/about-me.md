Hello people, I am **Tobin Harding**. I code in the Linux
environment. I like command line interfaces and statically typed
languages. When I am trying to relax I listen to classical music, when
I'm eating, jazz and when getting excitable I like to listen to
techno.  I like learning things, mostly computer related things, but
also piano. For health and giggles I wrestle, do yoga, ferment, and
grow vegetables.

I am a self declared apprentice Linux programmer. Ater completing
undergraduate and post graduate degrees in computer science, both in
software development, it became clear to me that I still did not know
how to code. One day I decided to open K&R and start from scratch. Two
years later, 40+ tech books, 7 languages, 40 000+ lines of code, 90+
kernel patches, I still considers myself an apprentice.

I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia.
