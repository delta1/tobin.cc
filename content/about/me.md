Hello people, I am **Tobin Harding**. I code in the Linux environment. I like
command line interfaces and statically typed languages. When I am trying to
relax I listen to classical music, when eating jazz, and when getting excitable
I like to listen to techno.  I like learning things, mostly computer related
things but also violin. For health and giggles I surf, do yoga, ferment, and
grow vegetables. I am an apprentice programmer, my primary language is Go.
