Eight years ago at Perth [LCA](https://linux.org.au/linux-conf-au/) I sat in the
kernel mini-conf for the first time and listened to a bunch of kernel hackers
discuss patching the kernel - at that moment I said to myself "I want to do
that".

I spent the next five years trying to become a kernel hacker, while I managed to
get a bunch of patches mainlined I never managed to get a paid gig doing kernel
work. In 2019 I joined a small start up in Sydney working on atomic swaps
between crypto assets, that was the start of my bitcoin dev journey however I
still had the dream of being a 'proper' open source developer. Next I had
another detour by way of working on a proprietary multi-chain wallet. And now,
finally, I have made it to my long searched for destination. Today I start paid
full time work on [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin) by way of an
open source grant.

Many, many years ago, I read Eric Raymond's [How To Become A
Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and since then I have
dreamt of working all day writing code and giving away the results of my labour.
From this day forward that dream has become a reality. I am humbled by this
opportunity and extremely grateful to those who made it possible.

Many thanks and much love,  
Tobin.
