## Open Source Experience

Open source contributions made to the following projects, among others:

* [Linux Kernel](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=me%40tobin.cc)
 (C ).
* [ZFS](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+zfs+) (C ).
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+kubernetes+) (Go) 
* Mystereum (blockchain, Go).
* Gonum graph library (Go).
* OpenBazaar-Server (Python).
* Guile Scheme (Scheme, C).
* Binutils, GNU Assembler (Documentation).

Linux kernel contributor since May 2016.  Author and maintainer of intree kernel
Perl script `scripts/leaking_addresses.pl`.  Responsible for hashing `printk`
specifier `%p`, landed in `v3.15`.  Involved in the removal of Variable Length Arrays
from the kernel tree, enabling `make -Wvla`.  Worked on layer 2 networking
code.  Focus on the KS7010 SDIO Wi-Fi driver.  PowerPC contributions; while resolving
PowerPC kernel issues contributed documentation patches to the GNU Assembler, as
well as assembly code.  Various other contributions to: device drivers (staging),
networking (including wireless), Kernel Self Protection Project, storage, and
memory management.  200+ patches merged into the mainline.

While studying data structures and algorithms contributed code, and design test
implementation, to the Gonum graph library written in Golang.  Utilized graph
library as reference while implementing solutions to graph problems on
HackerRank.

Contributed to the Free Software Foundation Guile project.  Interacted with Guile
community via public mailing list.  Iterated multiple revisions in order to
assimilate a personal fix into a patch that was acceptable by the
community.  Produced a solution to a known outstanding issue requiring a multi-
language patch set in C and Scheme.

Contributed to the OpenBazaar Server project, codebase in Python.  First
non-company contributor to the project.  Most patches were unit testing and code
refactoring.  Some work on the command line interface and interoperability
between operating systems.

## Education

### Apprenticeship

24 month software development apprenticeship.  Worked assiduously on becoming a
competent, professional programmer.  Maintained a minimum 40 hour working week
(typically 50+).
 [Logged](https://github.com/tcharding/work-logs) hours and topics
worked.  Topics include; computer architecture,
programming languages and theory, operating systems, data structures
and algorithms, professional software development methodology and practices.  See
below ‘code written in last 12 months’ and
[~/books](http://tobin.cc/reading-list).  Text highlights include;

* **The Art of Computer Programming** (volumes 1 and 2) Donald E. Knuth
* **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment** W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rag
* **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** Harold Abelson, Gerald
  Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman
* **Applied Cryptography** Bruce Schneier
* **Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** Robert C. Martin

See [Github](https://github.com/tcharding/self_learning) repository for code
written during apprenticeship.  All code worked on is open source unless
explicitly requested otherwise (i.e Project Euler, Eudyptula Challenge).

### Graduate Diploma in Computer Science [Pass with High Distinction]

University of New England, Australia (completed 2014).

* Parallel and Distributed Computing.
* Computer Architecture and Assembler.
* C++ Programming.
* Programming Languages for Artificial Intelligence.
* Web and Internet Programming.

### Bachelor of Science
University of Sydney, Australia (completed 2008).

* Awarded Bachelor of Science majoring in computer science. 
* Completed double major, software development and computer networking.

## Outside Experience

Founded the Central Coast Linux Users Group of New South Wales in
February 2014.  Announced the intent prior, at Linux open source
conference, Linux.conf.au.  Lead role in organizing and administering
the group.  Set up a unincorporated association for
governance.  Acquired sponsorship of venue to hold monthly
meetings.  Financially supported the group for the first three years.

Given presentations on software related topics at the Open Source Summit North
America 2017, Central Coast Linux Users Group (multiple) and the Australian
Computer Society (2015).

## Motivation for Writing Code

* Collaborating with others to produce the best possible codebase/project.
* Continually learning and refining skills and technique (the craft).
* How good ‘clean code’ looks on the screen.
* The feeling when an insurmountable problem dissolves.
* Constantly refining.
