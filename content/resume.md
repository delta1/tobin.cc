title = "Resume of Tobin Harding: Linux Programmer"
+++

* **Undergraduate** and **postgraduate** degrees in computer science.
* **12 years** experience using **Linux**.
* Apprenticeship, **2 years** full time programming. 
* **100+ patches** merged into the **Linux kernel**.
* **98th percentile** in algorithms on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/tcharding).
* **Founder** of The Central Coast Linux Users Group (LUG).

## Open Source Experience

Open source contributions made to the following projects, among others:

* Linux Kernel
  [mainline](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=me%40tobin.cc).
* Gonum graph library (Go).
* [OpenBazaar-Server](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar-Server/graphs/contributors) (Python).
* Guile Scheme (Scheme, C).
* Binutils, GNU Assembler (Documentation).

Primarily interested in layer 2 networking code within the Linux
kernel. 100+ patches merged into the kernel. Focus on the KS7010 Wi-Fi
driver (drivers/staging/ks7010). While resolving PowerPC kernel issues
contributed documentation patches to the GNU Assembler, as well as an
assembly code patch series within the kernel powerpc code. Also minor
bug fixes and clean up patches to the PowerPC tree as well as trivial
cleanup patches into the kernel core (net, purgatory, mm).

While studying data structures and algorithms contributed code, and
design test implementation, to the Gonum graph library written in
Golang. Utilized graph library as reference while implementing
solutions to graph problems on HackerRank.

Contributed to the Free Software Foundation Guile project. Interacted
with Guile community via public mailing list. Iterated multiple
revisions in order to assimilate a personal fix into a patch that was
acceptable by the community. Produced a solution to a known
outstanding issue requiring a multi-language patch set in C and
Scheme.

Two months focused work on OpenBazaar Server code in Python. First
non-company contributor to the project. Most patches were unit testing
and code refactoring. Some work on the command line interface and
interoperability between operating systems.

## Education

### Apprenticeship

24 month software development apprenticeship. Worked assiduously on becoming a
competent, professional programmer. Maintained a minimum 40 working week
(typically 50+).
[Logged](https://github.com/tcharding/work-logs) hours and topics
worked. Topics include; computer architecture,
programming languages and theory, operating systems, data structures
and algorithms, professional software development methodology and practices. See
below ‘code written in last 12 months’ and
[~/books](http://tobin.cc/reading-list). Text highlights include;

* **The Art of Computer Programming** (volumes 1 and 2) Donald E. Knuth
* **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment** W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rag
* **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman
* **Applied Cryptography** Bruce Schneier
* **Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** Robert C. Martin

### Graduate Diploma in Computer Science [Pass with High Distinction]

University of New England, Australia (completed 2014).

* Parallel and Distributed Computing.
* Computer Architecture and Assembler.
* C++ Programming.
* Programming Languages for Artificial Intelligence.
* Web and Internet Programming.
* Information Technology Project (dentist patient management application in Objective C).
* Graduate Diploma in Computer Science Project (UNIX shell written in C).

### Bachelor of Science
University of Sydney, Australia (completed 2008).

* Awarded Bachelor of Science majoring in computer science. 
* Completed double major, software development and computer networking.

## Outside Experience

Founded the Central Coast Linux Users Group of New South Wales in
February 2014. Announced the intent prior, at Linux open source
conference, Linux.conf.au. Lead role in organizing and administering
the group. Set up a unincorporated association for
governance. Acquired sponsorship of venue to hold monthly
meetings. Financially supported the group for the first three years.

## Motivation for Writing Code

* Continually learning and refining skills and technique.
* The social interaction of programming on a project together with others.
* How good ‘clean code’ looks on the screen.
* The feeling when an insurmountable problem dissolves.
* Constantly chasing perfection, efficiency of space and time, beauty of code.
* Programming craftsmanship.
