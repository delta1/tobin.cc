* **12 years** experience using **Linux**.
* **Undergraduate** and **postgraduate** degrees in computer science.
* **8 months** full time **Linux kernel** development experience.

## Current Position

Currently working at AppOrbit on the AppSwitch project.  From the project documentation:

	AppSwitch performs service discovery, access control and traffic management
	functions on behalf of the applications by transparently taking over the
	applications network API calls. 

Role involves writing Golang and C (kernel space and user space).  AppSwitch
includes a Linux kernel driver to intercept system calls and also provides the
same functionality in user space using BPF.

Testing done in Python, Bash, C, and Golang.  Responsible for writing and
maintaining end 2 end tests (written in Python and shell) utilising docker in
docker.

Position held since January 2018.

## Open Source Experience

Open source contributions made to the following projects, among others:

* [Linux Kernel](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=me%40tobin.cc)
 (C ).
* [ZFS](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+zfs+) (C ).
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Atcharding+kubernetes+) (Go) 
* Gonum graph library (Go).
* OpenBazaar-Server (Python).
* Guile Scheme (Scheme, C).
* Binutils, GNU Assembler (Documentation).

Occasionally work on the Linux kernel, primarily the Kernel Self Protection
Project and netdev. Also interested in filesystems, networking, device drivers
and security. Current Linux kernel maintainer of the leaking_addresses.pl
script.

Previously worked on layer 2 networking code within the Linux kernel. Focus on
the KS7010 Wi-Fi driver (drivers/staging/ks7010).  Also some Power PC work.
While resolving Power PC kernel issues contributed documentation patches to the
GNU Assembler, as well as an assembly code patch series within the kernel
PowerPC code.  Minor bug fixes and clean up patches to the Power PC tree as well
as trivial cleanup patches into the kernel core (net, purgatory, mm).

While studying data structures and algorithms contributed code, and design test
implementation, to the Gonum graph library written in Golang.  Utilized graph
library as reference while implementing solutions to graph problems on
HackerRank.

Contributed to the Free Software Foundation Guile project.  Interacted with
Guile community via public mailing list.  Iterated multiple revisions in order
to assimilate a personal fix into a patch that was acceptable by the community.
Produced a solution to a known outstanding issue requiring a multi-language
patch set in C and Scheme.

Two months focused work on OpenBazaar Server code in Python.  First non-company
contributor to the project.  Most patches were unit testing and code
refactoring.  Some work on the command line interface and interoperability
between operating systems.

## Education

### Apprenticeship

24 month software development apprenticeship.  Worked assiduously on becoming a
competent, professional programmer.  Maintained a minimum 40 hour working week
(typically 50+).
 [Logged](https://github.com/tcharding/work-logs) hours and topics
worked.  Topics include; computer architecture,
programming languages and theory, operating systems, data structures
and algorithms, professional software development methodology and practices.  See
below ‘code written in last 12 months’ and
[~/books](http://tobin.cc/reading-list).  Text highlights include;

* **The Art of Computer Programming** (volumes 1 and 2) Donald E. Knuth
* **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment** W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rag
* **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** Harold Abelson, Gerald
  Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman
* **Applied Cryptography** Bruce Schneier
* **Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** Robert C. Martin

See [Github](https://github.com/tcharding/self_learning) repository for code
written during apprenticeship.  All code worked on is open source unless
explicitly requested otherwise (i.e Project Euler, Eudyptula Challenge).

### Graduate Diploma in Computer Science [Pass with High Distinction]

University of New England, Australia (completed 2014).

* Parallel and Distributed Computing.
* Computer Architecture and Assembler.
* C++ Programming.
* Programming Languages for Artificial Intelligence.
* Web and Internet Programming.
* Information Technology Project (dentist patient management application in Objective C).
* Graduate Diploma in Computer Science Project (UNIX shell written in C).

### Bachelor of Science
University of Sydney, Australia (completed 2008).

* Awarded Bachelor of Science majoring in computer science. 
* Completed double major, software development and computer networking.

## Outside Experience

Founded the Central Coast Linux Users Group of New South Wales in
February 2014.  Announced the intent prior, at Linux open source
conference, Linux.conf.au.  Lead role in organizing and administering
the group.  Set up a unincorporated association for
governance.  Acquired sponsorship of venue to hold monthly
meetings.  Financially supported the group for the first three years.

Given presentations on software related topics at the Open Source Summit North
America 2017, Central Coast Linux Users Group (multiple) and the Australian
Computer Society (2015).

## Motivation for Writing Code

* Collaborating with others to produce the best possible codebase/project.
* Continually learning and refining skills and technique (the craft).
* How good ‘clean code’ looks on the screen.
* The feeling when an insurmountable problem dissolves.
* Constantly refining.
