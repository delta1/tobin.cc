topics related to software development. See [~/books](http://tobin.cc/reading-list)
for full listing, highlights include;

* **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman
* **The Art of Computer Programming** (volumes 1 and 2) Donald E. Knuth
* **Applied Cryptography** Bruce Schneier
* **Clean Code, A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** Robert C. Martin
* **UNIX Network Programming** W. Richard Stevens, Bill Fenner, Andrew M. Rudoff
* **Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment** W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rag
